## Description
A simple tool to check if your favorite streamers are live from
the command line.  
Essentially my [twitchlivechecker](https://gitlab.com/n00bady/twitchlivechecker)  but re-written in GO.  

## Build
`go build`

## Usage
`ttvchecker add streameName` to add a streamer.  
`ttvchecker del streamerName` to delete a streamer.  
`ttvchecker check` to see which streamers are live.  

## TODO
Many things...
